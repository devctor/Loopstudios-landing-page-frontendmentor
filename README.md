## My process
  I learn two new thecnologies for me. Playwright for testing amd Stitches as styling tool

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - For styles. CSS-in-JS with near-zero runtime
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - For reliable end-to-end testing


### What I learned

Whit this project i discover how useful can be a tool like Playwright for testing. With stitches just scratching the surfaces seems to be a more complete library than styled components.
